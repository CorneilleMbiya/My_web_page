Hello;
I would like to support my work with this little note, so far, I have been trying to make that first step in the world of web. Which seems to be already okay, I focus the most 
on the structure, the page itself than the functionalities. That is the reason why, some of the internal operations could not function properly.
The main idea is to come up with the main page, whichareas, every visitor will come accross. Either they are already members, they have just to login in and enjoy the service.
Otherwise, they will be required to sign up.
